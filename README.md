## Project Description 🌟

### 🗂️ Problem Statement

- There’s no way for clients to identify if the freelancers are competent in completing their jobs in the space. The clients also don't know if they can trust certain clients due to unverified payments.

- There’s currently not a reliable Web3 Job Marketplace available in the space. In Web3, employers who look out for freelancers to perform micro tasks / gigs, usually utilises Twitter and Discord for reachouts. These gigs typically include: Website Development, Discord Server Moderation, Smart Contract Audits and Community Management.


### 💻 Get Started

### ⚙️ Solution 

- Task givers may click the **'Attest'** button associated with a post, indicating their formal endorsement of the freelancer's satisfactory completion of the task.

- Attesting to posts serves as a concrete affirmation by task givers that the freelancer has executed the task with excellence and met their expectations.


### 🔥 Value Proposition

**👍🏼 Task completion attestation**

This pivotal feature empowers clients to provide professional endorsements upon task completion. These endorsements manifest as visible counters on the freelancer's profile, creating a robust **'Reputation System'**.
Enhanced reputation opens doors to improved job-seeking opportunities, forging a stronger connection between skills and success in the dynamic freelancing ecosystem.
Most importantly, harmonising the Web3 Space, helping each other out with job opportunities to climb up the ladder of reputation.

**💰 Client Payout attestation**

This feature empowers freelancers to vouch for clients upon receiving payment for successfully completed tasks. These endorsements are showcased as counters on clients' profiles, contributing to the augmentation of their reputation. This, in turn, fosters a heightened level of trust among freelancers, as they perceive clients who consistently fulfill their financial commitments as reliable partners within our platform's ecosystem.

## **Quadratic Funding Track 1 🔰**

**Recipient-Initiated Funding Proposals:** Our system allows project recipients to create comprehensive funding proposals. This means those seeking support have a structured and transparent way to present their projects, objectives, and financial requirements. This feature ensures proposals are well-defined and aligned with the challenge's goals.

**Donor Participation and Expression of Interest:** Donors are actively engaged in the process. They review funding proposals and express their interest or lack thereof in supporting specific projects. This element demonstrates that our system values donor input and choice, a key aspect of many challenges seeking innovative solutions.

**Commitment to Financial Support:** When donors express interest in a project, they have the option to commit financial support by clicking the 'Fund' button. This commitment signifies that our system aligns with challenges seeking to promote real-world financial contributions and commitment to impactful initiatives.

**Verification of Fund Utilization:** Our system incorporates a verification step through the 'Attest' button. Donors can verify that recipients are utilizing the funds as proposed, adding a layer of transparency and accountability that aligns with challenges focused on responsible resource allocation.

**Recipient Confirmation of Funds Received:** Conversely, recipients can also use the 'Attest' button to confirm the legitimate receipt of funds from donors. This reciprocal attestation reinforces transparency and trust in the financial transaction process.
